            <p id="body-p">Increased awareness of "non-traditional" business models, like that of Assist-2-Sell, North America's Leading Discount Real Estate Company &#8482;, has spawned a national debate about the differences between "traditional" real estate companies and "discount" real estate companies. People involved in the discussion try to characterize real estate companies as being either "traditional" or "discount". It would be more accurate to differentiate using three categories:</p>
            <ul id="body-ul">
              <li id="body-li">
                <h4 id="body-liTitle">Full-Service (High Commission)</h4>
                <p id="body-liP">So-called "traditional" real estate companies</p>
              </li>
              <li id="body-li">
                <h4 id="body-liTitle">Full-Service (Discounted Commission)</h4>
                <p id="body-liP">Assist-2-Sell</p>
              </li>
              <li id="body-li">
                <h4 id="body-liTitle">Limited Service (Discounted Commission)</h4>
                <p id="body-liP">Real estate companies that offer a "menu of services" or limited service. Fees are charged for the services that are selected, usually, but not always, at a discounted commission.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p id="body-p">As a "discounter", Assist-2-Sell is often inaccurately lumped in with the third catgory, "Limited Service (Discounted Commission)". A key difference between Assist-2-Sell and others in the "discount" real estate space is the level of service. Assist-2-Sell discovered early on that while sellers love the discounted commission, they stll need and want full-service. Assist-2-Sell franchise offices are full service real estate brokerages staffed by experienced, licensed real estate professionals who are members of the National Association of <span class="uppercase">Realtors&reg;</span>, as well as state and local <span class="uppercase">realtor</span> associations. They take care of everything home sellers need from a real estate company, but charge a lower commission. It's called <span class="italic prm-color bold">"Full Service with $avings!"</span> &reg;, <span class="italic prm-color bold">"Full Service for Less!"</span> &reg;, and <span class="italic prm-color bold">"Results with Savings!"</span> &reg;.</p>

              <h3 id="body-h3">The Difference Between Assist2Sell and "Traditional" Real Estate</h3>
              <p id="body-p">The most obvious difference between Assist-2-Sell and "traditional" real estate companies lies in the commission structure. Traditional firms typically charge home sellers a high commission that is a percentage of the sale price. (Example: 6%). Assist-2-Sell office scharge a low, flat fee commission. (Example: As low as $2,995!). They believe that <span class="italic bold prm-color">"Friends Don't Let Friends Pay 6%"</span> &#8482;.</p>
              <p id="body-p">With Assist-2-Sell, home sellers are also given a choice as to how their home is marketed.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph2">
              <h3 id="body-h3">The <span class="bold prm-color">MLS for Less</span>&#8482; Program</h3>
              <p id="body-p">This program adds the benefits of the MLS, while still offering home sellers the opportunity to pay only the low, flat fee should the home buyer purchase directly through Assist-2-Sell. Under this program, a low commission is typically added to the cost. (Example: 3%). If an MLS agent brings the home buyer, they receive the 3% - Assist-2-Sell receives only their low, flat fee. If the buyer comes directly to Assist-2-Sell, the seller pays only the low, flat feet, and not the additional 3%.</p>
              <p id="body-p"><span class="bold uppercase">note: </span>Programs and fees vary by office, and specific fee structures should be confirmed by <a id="body-a" href="#">local Assist-2-Sell offices.</a></p>

            <div class="paragraph3">
              <h3 id="body-h3">The Difference Between Assist2Sell and Other "Discount" Real Estate</h3>
              <p id="body-p">Assist-2-Sell is a <span class="italic">full service</span> discount real estate company. Other companies that discount their commission usually do so by taking away services. If they charge less, they are going to do less.</p>
              <p id="body-p">Some "Limited Service (Discounted Commission)" companies charge upfront fees. Others are Internet-based and may only offer placement of the house in the MLS and rely on the MLS-selling broker to handle the entire transaction. While these models do have some appeal, Assist-2-Sell has found they are not a solution for hte majority of home sellers who want and need full-service but don't want to py a high commission.</p>

            <div class="paragraph4">
              <h3 id="body-h3">The Difference Between Assist2Sell and "For Sale By Owner" Real Estate</h3>
              <p id="body-p">Many homeowners decide to sell their home without the assistance of a real estate broker. Most "For Sale By Owner" (FSBO) real estate companies simply help these homeowners advertise their house on the Internet. Assist-2-Sell is not a "For Sale By Owner" solution; it is a <span class="italic">full-service</span> real estate brokerage.</p>
              <p id="body-p">Assist-2-Sell understands why many people decide to sell their home by themselves, and it is ready to assist with its "Paperwork Only" program. Assist-2-Sell can help with the sales contract and the closing for an even lower, flat fee. This is our Seller Assist &#8482; program</p>
